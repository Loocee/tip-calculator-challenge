## The Tip Calculator calculates tip amount for various percentages of the cost of the service, and also provides a total amount that includes the tip. In the U.S., a tip of 15% of the before tax meal price is typically expected. To know more about the tip calculator and how it works please visit (https://www.calculator.net/tip-calculator.html)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- jQuery


### What I learned
I learned more DOM manipulations. I also tried to refactor my stylesheets. I also learned the difference between parseInt() and parseFloat().
I believe I struggled with trying to replicate the mobile design, but I couldn't get the layout, so I did my thing. I think next time I'll try to build mobile before the system layout.
